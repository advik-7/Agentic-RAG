# 🌱 Agentic RAG  🌳

This repository contains a project for creating an Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system focused on **sandalwood cultivation**

## 🚀 Features

- **Audio Data Processing**: Converts audio recordings into text using Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR).
- **RAG Framework**: Combines retrieval of sandalwood cultivation insights with generative responses.
- **Agentic Behavior**: Supports proactive queries and follow-ups based on user interactions.
- **Custom Dataset**: Includes a preprocessed dataset of sandalwood cultivation tips, pest management strategies, and climate requirements.
- **Multilingual Support**: Can handle audio in multiple languages commonly spoken in sandalwood farming regions.
- **Fine-Tuned LLMs**: Integrates fine-tuned models optimized for agriculture-specific queries.

## 🗂️ Dataset

The project uses an **audio dataset** containing:

- Farmers' questions and experts' answers about sandalwood cultivation.
- Tips on pest management, irrigation, and soil requirements.
- Regional climate guidelines and their effects on growth patterns.

Ensure that your dataset is in `.wav` or `.mp3` format. Use a transcription tool (e.g., `SpeechRecognition` or `Whisper`) to convert audio into text.
